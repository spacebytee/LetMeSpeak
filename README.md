Saves chat states in Minecraft.

Saves your chat state as you type, and clears it once you send the message or manually exit chat. This way you never have to retype anything. I was considering preventing other GUIs from interrupting chat, however, there are some concerns over behavior which not all scenarios may be accounted for, so I'm holding off on that as it isn't completely necessary.
